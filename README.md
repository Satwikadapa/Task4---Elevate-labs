# Task4---Elevate-labs
Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows



# Objective
The goal of this task is to configure and test basic firewall rules using Windows Defender Firewall. This involves blocking traffic on a specific port (Telnet - port 23), verifying the rule, and then removing it. The task enhances understanding of how firewalls filter and control network traffic.

 5. Removed the Block Rule
- Restored firewall to the original state by deleting the custom rule.


##  Learnings & Takeaways
- Understood how Windows Firewall filters network traffic using rule-based configurations.
- Gained hands-on experience in managing firewall rules.
- Realized the importance of blocking insecure protocols like Telnet (port 23).
- Learned how allowing and blocking specific ports helps improve overall system security.
